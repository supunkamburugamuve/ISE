In this paper I urge friends of truth-value gaps and truth-value gluts -- proponents of paracomplete and paraconsistent logics -- to consider theories not merely as sets of sentences, but as <em>pairs</em> of sets of sentences, or what I call 'bitheories,' which keep track not only of what <em>holds</em> according to the theory, but also what <em>fails</em> to hold according to the theory.  I explain the connection between bitheories, sequents, and the speech acts of assertion and denial. I illustrate the usefulness of bitheories by showing how they make available a technique for characterising different theories while abstracting away from logical vocabulary such as connectives or quantifiers, thereby making theoretical commitments independent of the choice of this or that particular non-classical logic.  

Examples discussed include theories of numbers, classes and truth.  In the latter two cases, the bitheoretical perspective brings to light some heretofore unconsidered puzzles for friends of na&iuml;ve theories of classes and truth.
