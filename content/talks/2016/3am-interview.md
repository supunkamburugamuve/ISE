A few weeks ago, Richard Marshall interviewed me for [3am Magazine](http://www.3ammagazine.com)'s series of interviews with philosophers. If you're interested in my work on logical pluralism, proof theory and things like that, [this interview](http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/the-logical-pluralist/) might be a good place to start. I hope you like it. If you've got any questions, please let me know.
