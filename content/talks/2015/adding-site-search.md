I've added a search feature to the site in the [footer](#footer) of each page. There seems to be [enough on the site](/news) that search is genuinely useful.

I've used [DuckDuckGo](http://duckduckgo.com), which has a comprehensive index of this place, and which [can be styled](https://duckduckgo.com/params) to match the visual treatment of the rest of the site. Please [let me know](#contact) if there are any problems with the implementation.
