I'm giving a talk entitled “Incarnation and Detachment: Philosophy, Prayer, and Taking Positions” at the first 2015 meeting of the [Christian Scholars Network](http://christianscholarsnetwork.tumblr.com). (We'll meet at the [Dan O'Connell Pub](http://www.thedan.com.au) at 7pm on Tuesday March 24. Come early to share dinner before the talk and discussion.)

In the talk I'll discuss some of the parallels between the range of cognitive attitudes to be found in reasoning and philosophical reflection on the one hand, and prayer, on the other. 

The [Christian Scholars Network](http://christianscholarsnetwork.tumblr.com) is a ministry of [St. James Old Cathedral](http://sjoc.org.au). Anyone who is interested in the intersection of faith and intellect is entirely welcome to participate. It's coordinated by [Rev.](http://www.sjoc.org.au/people/staff) [Dr. Jeffrey Hanson](http://corner.acu.edu.au/research_supervision/framework/browse.php?srperid=2260).  For more information, see [the Network&rsquo;s website](http://christianscholarsnetwork.tumblr.com).
