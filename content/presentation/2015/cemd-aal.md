A presentation for the [Australasian Association for Logic Conference](http://www-personal.usyd.edu.au/~njjsmith/aal2015/) at the University of Sydney. I will discuss Tim Williamson's arguments for the non-contingency of existence (see his *[Modal Logic as Metaphysics](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199552078.do)*, 2013) and explain how and why they might be reasonably resisted. Along the way, I'll try to explain the impact of proof theory for theories of meaning and for metaphysics.
